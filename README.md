# 2022 LOL Analysis

## Introduction

This project conducts an in-depth analysis on the 2022 public match data for League of Legends which can be found [here](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads). It contains various information on each match such as the league it was played in, kills/deaths, towers, dragons, position of the player, etc. as well as the aggregated data of the team for each match. For the sake of this project, we will focus on only the aggregated team data. We will explore the importance of different factors in a game, including kills, resources, objectives, with an emphasis on the side. Additionally, we will explore the differences between matches in different leagues such as the LPL and LCK by comparing metrics that evaluate the action of a game.
